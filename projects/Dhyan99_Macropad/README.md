# YOUR PROJECT NAME\
\
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->\
This board will act as a Macropad on my desk to control lighting, quick actions, etc. I\'92ve always wanted to have one but didn\'92t feel like it was worth buying one. Once I found out about onBoard, I decided to make one myself\'85. So I can show it off to others.\
\
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->\
It will cost about $70 excluding shipping if purchased through JLCPCB, including the placement of parts on both sides\
\
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->\
I looked up a few tutorials on how to make macropads and once I knew how to wire them up and how to use KiCad properly, I started making mine.}
